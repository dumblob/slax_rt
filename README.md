slax_rt
=======

Nasty major modifications to Slax build scripts to add support for real-time Linux kernels

Usage
-----

Run `kernel.SlackBuild.rt` without arguments to get help. This will download, configure, compile and copy all the needed stuff to the given Slax directory (e.g. on a flash drive) automatically.

Notes
-----

This repository is a copy of the `http://ftp.slax.org/Slax-7.x-development/sources/Slax-7.0-sources/kernel/` directory with modified scripts to exchange the bundled Linux kernel with its real-time version.
